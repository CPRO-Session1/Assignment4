1. Character arrays are arrays of characters. For example: char c='a';. Strings are arrays of characters. For example: char[10]="Hello World";. What this will do is assign char[0]='H', char[1]='e', char[2]='l', char[3]='l', char[4]='o', char[5]=' ', char[6]='W', char[7]='o', char[8]='r', char[9]='l', char[10]='d'. String assignment is only at declaration. Also, at the beginning of the program should use "#include <string.h>". 

2. The advantages of arrays in C are that it is very easy to store many integers in an array.  The disadvantages of arrays in C are that the size can't change after the declaration. 

3. The compiler does not implicitly generate the address of the first element of an array when an array appears as an expression. 

4. Two strings can be compared to see if they're equivalent in content by using strcmp(), and if the output is 0, then the strings are equal.
