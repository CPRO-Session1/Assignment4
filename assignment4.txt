Christopher Liu - I didn't get question 3
1. A string allows you to use string operations, and ends with '\0'.
2. Arrays are useful because they're an organized way to create a bunch of variables with the same type. Disadvantages are the size of arrays cannot be changed, and all the variables of the array must be the same type.
3. It does not implicitly generate the address of an array when it is used in an operator such as sizeof()
4. You would use strcmp() after including string.h. The function will return zero if the strings are equivalent in content.
