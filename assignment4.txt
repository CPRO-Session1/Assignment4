1. A string is collection of characters that can make up words or sentences. In order to read a string in C, strings have to be split into character arrays which break apart the string into individual chars.

2. Arrays are advantageous because they give the programmer complete control over what's inside and organizes data. It is easy and efficient to create an array and add/delete things from the array. A disadvantage is that they can be difficult to navigate sometimes and require a lot of loops to organize/search through.

3. The compiler won't implicitly generate the address of the first element in the array when an array is initialized without values originally added to it.

4. The easiest way to compare two strings to see if they're equal is the function strcmp(). If 0 is returned, the strings are equal.
