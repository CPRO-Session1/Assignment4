Assignment 4 Part 2

1. Discuss the differences between string and a character array
	Character Arrays and Strings are very similar, with the only main difference
	between them being that a string is a character array that must end with '\0'.
2. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of arrays in C
	Arrays are very useful for storing multiple elements of the same data
	type and then being able to draw upon that data. This can be much more
	useful than just making a bunch of different variables of the same type.
	The main disadvantages of arrays is that they are static. This means that
	you can't change an array's size after it's created. What this further means
	is that you need to know in advance how many elements you are going to 
	need to store in order to be efficient and not create an array which is
	too big, which would waste space.
3. When does the compiler not implicitly generate the address of the first element
of an array?
	I have no idea for this one. I looked it up and none of the answers made 
	much sense to me. From what it said(so not me), it's when it's the operand of
	the sizeOf() function.
4. How would two strings be compared to see if they're equivalent in content?
	This can be done by using the #include <string.h> statement at the beginning
	of the code to import string functions. One of these is the function to
	compare strings, strcmp(). Put the two srings you wish to compare into the
	parentheses separated by a comma and the function will return 0 if they
	are equivalent, -1 if the second string comes before the first in
	lexicographical order and 1 if the first string comes before the second
	in lexicographical order.
