1. A char array is an array of single characters. When initializing, single quotes are used. However, for strings, it is a data structure that is an
array of characters. Strings end in \0 (as the last character) and is initialized with double quotes.

2. Advantages:
- You can have one name for the same objects and save them with different indexes.
- Super useful when working with the same kind of data.

Disadvantages:
- It is not easy to work with arrays with many indexes.
- C doesn't have out of bounds check for the arrays.

3. The compiler does not do this, but generates the address of the first element whenever the array
appears in an expression.

4. You could use the strcmp() function to compare them.
