1. The difference between a string and a character array is that a string is an array of a collection of characters. A string is like a book, and the character array is like the pages.

2. The advantages of arrays in C is that you have complete and direct control over the arrays and how they are setup/used. However, the cost of that is a very tedious and painful system involving loops and arrays when it comes to using strings.

3. The complier doesn't implicitly generate the address of the first element of an array whenever the array is ONLY being initialize without having values assigned to it. For example: array[10];

4. In order to compare the two strings, you would use the fuction strcmp(). If it returns 0, then the strings are the same. If it returns with a positive number, it means string2 comes before string1 in lexicographical order. If it returns with a negative number, it means string1 comes before string2 in lexicographical order. Some operating systems even show how far apart they are.
