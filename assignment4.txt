1.The biggest difference between a string and a character array is a string has the '\0' character at the end.  
2. Arrays are very helpful when using the same data type. They are not helpful if they are from a different data type. Also, there is no checking mechanism for array sizes.
3. This occurs when an array name appears in an expression such as when its an operand of the sizeof operator, or as an operand of & operator.
4. Each character would be compared and if they were all equal, a 0 would be the output.
