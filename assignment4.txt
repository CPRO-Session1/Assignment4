1. A string is a character array with a \0 escape character at the end that allows for it to use the functions provided by string.h
2. advantages of an array in C is that you can use a for loop to run through them, allowing for easy processing of large amounts of a data type, as well as easy declaration of a large number of variables of the same data type. Disadvantages of an array in C is that its size is determined upon declaration, which means a new one must be made if you want to expand size, and if you want to reduce size there is wasted memory.
3. Only when you specify a memory location(Only possible in languages that allow for such actions)
4. Compared character by character, if the two characters at the same location are equivalent across all locations within the strings, it is determined th strings are equivalent
