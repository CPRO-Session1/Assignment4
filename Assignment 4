1. Discuss the differences between strings and a character array.
Answer:
A string is an array of chars, and an array is a group of characters within the same type. An array is static, and we can't change its size after declarition, while we can change the strings after declaeition. There is always a "\0" at the end of a string, while an array doesn't have that. 

2. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of arrays in C.
Answer:
Advantage: We can use it to store and use a group of similar data.
Disadvantage: We can't change the property like the size of the array, which will make our programming not convenient.

3. When does the compiler not implicitly generate the address of the first element of an array?
Answer:
There are three situations:
1. The array is a string literal initializer for a character array;
2. The array is a operend of sizeof operator;
3. The array is a operand of "&" operator.

4. How would two strings be compared to see if theyâ€™re equivalent in content?
Answer:
Using the string function: strcmp(string1,string 2);
It is comparing string 2 to string 1.
If it returns 0, the two string are equivalent.
