1. A character array is a data structure of which the elements are of data
   type character. A string is a data type that is made of an array of 
   characters. 
2. A disadvantage is that arrays can become confusing, especially if many 
   of them are implemented. Their size can also not be changed once set.
   However, they are useful when working with lots of values of the same
   data type, which you can then be able to store under one name. 
3. When the array is initialized without the values originally assigned. 
4. You would use the function strcmp(). If it returns 0, the strings 
   the same. If it returns with a positive or negative number, they are 
   after or before each other in a lexographical order.
